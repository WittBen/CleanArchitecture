# CleanArchitecture

This repository provides a practical example of implementing Clean Architecture in C#. The Clean Architecture pattern separates the concerns of an application into different layers, ensuring a flexible and scalable codebase. This project demonstrates how to structure a C# solution following this principle, making it easier to maintain and extend.

## Features
- Clean Architecture implementation
- Separation of concerns into layers
- Practical example with tests
